ASCII Art Generator in Go
Overview
This project is an ASCII art generator implemented in Go. It takes a string as input and outputs the string in a graphical representation using ASCII characters. The program can handle input strings containing numbers, letters, spaces, special characters, and newline characters.

Features
Supports ASCII art representation for a wide range of characters.
Uses provided banner files with pre-defined ASCII art templates for each character.
Command-line interface for easy usage.
Written in Go for efficiency and portability.
Simple and easy-to-understand code structure.
Usage
To use the ASCII art generator, simply run the program with a string as a command-line argument. For example:

go
Copy code
go run main.go "Hello, World!"
This will output the graphical representation of the input string using ASCII characters.

Banner Files
The project includes several banner files (shadow.txt, standard.txt, thinkertoy.txt) with pre-defined ASCII art templates for characters. You can customize these banner files or add new ones to extend the supported characters or modify their graphical representation.
